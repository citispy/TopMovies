# TopMovies
I worked on this project while completing the [Architect Android apps with MVP, Dagger, Retrofit & RxJava](https://www.udemy.com/architect-android-apps-with-mvp-pattern-rxjava-dagger-retrofit-junit/learn/v4/overview) on Udemy.

The app displays a list of top rated movies in a RecyclerView.

Some things that I included in this project that was not part of the course include the addition of movie posters, and a infite scroll.
